# SEEC-2025-3D-Printable-Rocket
An educational 3D-printable model rocket inspired by the capsule separation of Blue Origin’s New Shepard. Designed for classroom engagement, featuring SolidWorks files, STLs, and a full setup guide.1`
Educational Model Rocket – Blue H2O SEEC 2025 Project
This repository contains all the design files and documentation for a subscale model rocket created for the Blue H2O Mission, part of the International Aerospace Academy’s Orbital Learning Alliance initiative presented at SEEC 2025.

The project serves as an interactive educational tool that visually demonstrates the stages of a suborbital rocket launch and capsule separation — aimed at bringing aerospace engineering concepts to life in the classroom.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This rocket model is inspired by the visual configuration and capsule separation style of Blue Origin’s New Shepard. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representative of Blue Origin in any official capacity.

🚀 What’s Included
🧩 SolidWorks files – Complete 3D CAD model of the rocket and capsule

🖨️ STL files – Ready-to-print parts for 3D printing

📄 Setup Guide (PDF) – Includes assembly steps, safety notes, and launch tips

🔧 Designed for use with ESTES motors

🎓 Built for STEM/STEAM education, outreach events, or model rocketry projects

🌐 Project Background
This model was created as part of a virtual presentation for SEEC 2025, hosted by Space Center Houston. It was developed to help educators bridge the gap between aerospace engineering and hands-on learning in classrooms around the world. By mimicking the behavior of a real suborbital system at a smaller, safe scale, this rocket makes aerospace more approachable for students and educators alike.
